### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the owner of [Bezpieczny Kod](https://bezpiecznykod.pl), a consulting and training company providing cybersecurity services. We help companies secure software on each phase of the SDLC.

Iâ€™ve run application security workshops for several years now. Iâ€™ve also created an online appsec course: [Akademia Bezpiecznego Kodu](https://bezpiecznykod.pl/akademia/) ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±.

One of my goals is to raise security awareness thatâ€™s why I regularly present at industry events, both local and international (e.g. We Are Developers, 4Developers, Boiling Frogs, The H@ck Summit, SEMAFOR, et cetera).

I run my own podcast [Bezpieczna Produkcja](https://bezpiecznykod.pl/podcast) ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± in which Iâ€™m helping people working in IT to understand cybersecurity. Iâ€™m a big fan of podcasting myself, so Iâ€™m always eager to share my experience in other shows.

If this isnâ€™t enough yet, I also have a [newsletter](https://appsec.pl) ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± where I send valuable appsec materials to my subscribers (including *#Devs #QAs #Ops #Managers #CTOs #CISOs*).

Do you have more questions? Shoot me an email at andrzej@dyjak.me or visit [my blog](https://dyjak.me) ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±.
