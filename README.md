### Hi, I'm Andrzej! ðŸ‘‹

My cybersecurity career started over 15 years ago. During this time, I moved from hacking to securing, which has given me the perspective of both an attacker and a defender. I currently run a consulting and training company called [Bezpieczny Kod](https://bezpiecznykod.pl). In this role, I'm empowering teams with skills and advising on best practices for securing software across the SDLC.

In recent years, I have trained hundreds of IT specialists (QA, Dev, Ops) in subjects such as Security Testing, Threat Modeling, DevSecOps, and Secure By Design. I emphasize hands-on learning in my trainings, ensuring that engineering teams can immediately put new skills to use in their day-to-day tasks.

The demand I encountered from clients during trainings led me to offer consulting services. As a Trusted Advisor, I now assist companies in establishing and enhancing security for software they're developing.

I'm also an active content creator. I'm building an open community around application security [Discord](https://bezpiecznykod.pl/discord), run a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrzejDyjak) and [Podcast](https://bezpiecznykod.pl/podcast), and send out [a weekly newsletter](https://bezpiecznykod.pl/newsletter). I've also created an online course ["Offensive Testing of Web Applications"](https://ofensywnetestowanie.pl) (OTWA) and I'm already [building another one](https://abcdevsecops.pl) (on the topic of DevSecOps). My activities are aimed at educating and creating a space for IT professionals to exchange knowledge.
