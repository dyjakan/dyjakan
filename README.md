### Hello, I'm Andrzej Dyjak! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a security architect and strategic advisor helping technology leaders design and implement secure, compliant software development practices at scale. With over 20 years in cybersecurity â€”from offensive testing to enterprise architectureâ€” I now focus on integrating security and compliance into the SDLC to make security an enabler, not a bottleneck.

In recent years, Iâ€™ve trained thousands of engineers and helped leading financial and insurance institutions in Poland build mature Secure SDLC, DevSecOps, and Threat Modeling programs.
